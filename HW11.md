 Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
 Logistic Regression with resampling using Oversampling has the best balanced accuracy score, although Logistic Regression with combination has a balanced accuracy score very close to oversampling.

 Which model had the best recall score?
 Logistic Regression Model with Combination Sampling using SMOTEENN 0.73  that is greater than 0.71 (in Oversampling) in High risk that is our goal. Both models have very close their balanced accuracy score.

> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
 Easy Ensemble Classifier is the model with the best Balanced Accuracy Score with 0.93. The Random forest.. has a low balanced accuracy score. 
>
> Which model had the best recall score?
  Easy Ensemble Classifier has the best recall score with 0.92 in high risk that is our goal. 
  >
> Which model had the best geometric mean score?
>
  Easy Ensemble Classifier has the best geometrc mean score with 0.93 in high risk that is our goal. 

> What are the top three features?
    According to the model Random Forest Classifier the top three features in importance are:
    total_rec_prncp  0.07023
    last_pymnt_amnt  0.06997 
    total_pymnt_inv  0.06826

  Observation: Although the imbalance in the ensemble models keep staying, the Easy Ensemble look like as the best model to identify the high risk credits that is the problem to solve.
